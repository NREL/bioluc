##Github
For directions on using Github please see Github guide available on the front page of your user profile.

##Software
Running simulations requires [STELLA 10.0.3](http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/Education/StellaSoftware.aspx).
See [ISEE Systems] (http://www.iseesystems.com) for documentation and training.

####Trial Version Will Allow:
-	The running of the model
-	The use of the user interface

####Trail Version Will Not Allow:
-	Data importing
-	Making or saving  changes to the model 

####Full Version Will:
-	Allow access to all the features of the BioLUC model.

##File Structure and Description

####Models and Data
Located within this folder are versions of the BioLUC model and
The latest version of the BioLUC model is [here]( https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/tree/master/Model%20and%20Data/19-Region%20Model).
Two files associated with latest version of model are located [here]( https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/tree/master/Model%20and%20Data/19-Region%20Model/data). 
The first file is “Outputs Visualizations.xlsx” which automatically visualizes results exported from BioLUC using the tables in the interface. When exporting data from BioLUC using the interface, the Excel file should already be open. See the “readme” spreadsheet in the “Outputs Visualizations.xlsx” file for additional directions.
The second file is “BioLUC Data Processing and Model Inputs_2013-10-01.xlsx “which includes data, data processing, and data documentation associated with BioLUC. This file can be used to understand the sources of data, how data was proceed, and multiple alternative scenarios that can be used as input into BIOLUC See the “readme” spreadsheet for details, but this Excel file. THIS FILE IS IN PROGRESS AND WILL BE COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 7th.
An older 2-region version of the model is available [here]( https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/tree/master/Model%20and%20Data/Old%202-Region%20Model)

####User Guidance
Documentation of the BioLUC model can be found [here](https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/tree/master/documents).
Documentation describes the model and directs users through the using the basic features of the BioLUC model.
Portions of these documents are excerpted on the [wiki]( https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/wiki)

####Model Testing
Includes a presentation documenting the general testing the BioLUC model underwent prior to release. Please note that the presentation is not completely current as it was created prior to testing over the summer 2013.
The [Sensitivity Analysis](https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/tree/master/Model%20Testing/Senstivity%20Analysis) folder includes a report and sensitivity analysis completed by Eric Bryant using a semi-final version of the model.

####Workshop at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) May 7-8th
This folder contains documents and presentations used in the land use workshop at ORNL on May 7-8th.
Please note that these documents may not be up to-date.

##Wiki and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
I wiki and FAQ is under development [here](https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/wiki)
The wiki include an overview of the BioLUC model, additional guidance for using the BioLUC model, documentation of know modeling limitations and data issues, and a FAQ.
The wiki and FAQ are works in-progress for later in 2014.

####Interacting with the BioLUC Development Team
We are open to questions unrelated to troubleshooting Github and Stella, the raising of issues associated with the model or the general topic of land use change, and bugs associated with the BioLUC model.

Options for interactions:

1.	Submit an issue [ticket](https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open) to Ethan Warner [here]( https://github.com/NREL/bioluc/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open). 

2.	Email ethan.warner@nrel.gov or daniel.inman@nrel.gov directly
