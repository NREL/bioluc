Making Batch Runs
-----------------

1. Open the Excel workbook with the input data and export the sheet for each run into separate .csv files named "input-1.csv", "input-2.csv", etc.  These should all be in the "data\Input Data V2" subdirectory.

2. Check to make sure the path to STELLA in the file "single.cmd" is correct and fix it if it is not.

3. Click on the "multiple.cmd" file or execute it from a command window.  A command window should open and STELLA should launch periodically and run a simulation.


Visualizing Batch Runs

4. Open the Tableau workbook "data\Input Data V2\diagnostics.twb".

5. If an "Extract Not Found" dialog box is displayed, select "Regenerate the extract".

6. Otherwise, the workbook should open and you should select "Refresh all extracts" from the "Data" menu.
