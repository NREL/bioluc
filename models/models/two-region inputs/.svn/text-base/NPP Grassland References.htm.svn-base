        <DD>Data are presented from ten central and western North American 
        grasslands, covering six major grasslands types: mountain grassland, 
        northwest bunchgrass, mixed-grass prairie, shortgrass prairie, tallgrass 
        prairie and desert grassland. The experimental design at each location 
        included two replications of ungrazed and grazed treatments. Measured 
        environmental variables included precipitation, temperature and solar 
        radiation, both as annual and growing-season values, along with annual 
        and growing-season actual evapotranspiration. Seasonal above-ground live 
        biomass averaged 94 g/m2 for the ten grasslands (98 g/m2 for ungrazed 
        and 89 g/m2 for grazed treatments). Dead matter averaged about 160 g/m2 
        for ungrazed and 70 g/m2 for grazed treatments. Total above-ground 
        standing crop (total clipped matter) averaged 203 g/m2 (245 g/m2 
        ungrazed; 161 g/m2 grazed). In general, the amount of litter 
        corresponded to the total standing crop. The shortgrass prairie had the 
        greatest amount of crown material, and the tallgrass prairie the least 
        (about 275 g/m2 for short- and mixed-grass prairie, cf. 200 g/m2 for 
        tallgrass prairie). Although grazing did not significantly influence 
        crown material, it tended to increase under grazing in mixed and 
        short-grass prairies. Root biomass ranged from 156 g/m2 in the desert 
        grassland to as much as 2000 g/m2 in the mixed-grass prairie. There was 
        an inverse relationship between root biomass dynamics and mean annual 
        temperature; grazing generally resulted in an increase in root/shoot 
        ratios, particularly for the cooler grassalands.</DD></DL>

        <DD>Intra-seasonal dynamics are presented for the various above-ground 
        and below-ground primary producer compartments for ten central and 
        western North American grassland sites. Above-ground live biomass 
        followed either a unimodal growth pattern (for cool-season or 
        warm-season communities, in general), or a bimodal pattern (for mixed 
        cool- and warm-season communities). There were no significant 
        differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in seasonal live 
        biomass, although there was a significant site x treatment interaction. 
        Peak live biomass ranged from 84 to 336 g/m2, and showed a linear 
        increase with growing-season precipitation up to 450 mm, leveling out 
        beyond that. Maximum accumulation rates of live biomass were 0.4-6.5 
        g/m2/day. The recently-dead compartment showed maximum values soon after 
        attainment of peak live biomass; old-dead, however, was maximal early in 
        the growing season, declining thereafter as material was transferred to 
        the litter compartment. Litter dynamics responded closely to 
        precipitation events, and showed a rather erratic pattern. Root biomass 
        was maximal about midway through the growing season. Grazed treatments 
        typically had a higher peak root biomass in cooler grasslands, whereas 
        no such response was seen in warmer grasslands.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Levels of net primary production and efficiencies of energy capture 
        and water use were investigated in six grassland types encompassing ten 
        western North American grasslands. Above-ground net primary productivity 
        (ANPP) ranged from 54 to 523 g/m2/yr; the average for grazed grasslands 
        was 212 g/m2/yr compared with 236 g/m2/yr ungrazed grasslands 
        (P&lt;0.05). There was an apparent linear increase in ANPP with 
        increasing precipitation up to approx. 500 mm/yr. Likewise, ANPP 
        increased linearly with both growing-season and annual actual 
        evapotranspiration (AET). Net root production ranged from 148 to 641 
        g/m2/yr, and was significantly higher on grazed compared with ungrazed 
        grasslands. In general, root production increased with decreasing 
        long-term mean annual temperature. Total net primary productivity (TNPP) 
        ranged from 225 to 1425 g/m2/yr. Approx. 46% and 58% of the variablility 
        in TNPP was explained by annual precipitation in ungrazed and grazed 
        grasslands, respectively. Warmer grasslands had higher rates of crown 
        turnover, corresponding to increased annual usable incident solar 
        radiation and annual AET. Average rates of root turnover were 0.18, 0.30 
        and 0.49 for mixed-grass, tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, 
        respectively, with a positive curvilinear relationship between root 
        turnover and total annual usable incident solar radiation. Efficiency of 
        energy capture in TNPP ranged from 0.12% to more than 1.4% for both 
        ungrazed and grazed grasslands - communities dominated by cool-season 
        species appeared to be comparable to or more efficient than warm-season 
        species in terms of energy capture. Grasslands with higher water use 
        efficiencies also had higher efficiency of energy capture - these two 
        functional properties appeared to be positively related.</DD></DL>

      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>The lifetime of leaves of five common chalkland grasses was 
        determined: depending on species and time of year, this varied from 6 
        weeks to 6 months. Measurements from marked leaves could be described as 
        a function of temperature and time to 50% death. Applying turnover time 
        to harvest data increased estimates of ANPP to 691 g/m2/yr, more than 2 
        x the sum of species increments in biomass (332 g/m2/yr), but less than 
        the maximum of biomass plus dead matter (773 g/m2/yr). Results from 
        other studies also show that determination of biomass turnover is 
        necessary for correct estimation of primary production by harvest 
        methods.</DD></DL>

      <DL>
        <DD>We studied organic matter production in the <I>Trachypogon</I> 
        savanna of the Estacion Biologica de Los Llanos at Calabozo, Venezuela. 
        Biomass was harvested within two study areas, burned and unburned. 
        Above-ground biomass matter production was relatively low (429 
        g/m2/year), compared with the mean values for tropical savannas after 
        Rodin and Bazilevich (2000 g/m2/year). There is an annual rhythm in 
        production throughout the year, as shown by experiments carried out on 
        irrigated plots. When the wet season was prolonged using irrigation, the 
        maximum live biomass in the burned and irrigated plot was 50% lower, and 
        67% lower in the unburned and irrigated plot, compared with the maximum 
        biomass at the end of the rainy season for the unburned, non-irrigated 
        plot.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>We determined the exchange of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ammonia 
        for Trachypogon savannas using an energy balance approach. Monthly dry 
        matter and nitrogen content of plant parts were used for growth analysis 
        of the community. Net assimilation rate was 0.102-0.127 MJ/m2/day 
        (6.6-7.9 g dry matter/m2/day), similar to mean crop growth rate 
        determined by growth analysis. Apparent efficiency of light energy 
        conversion was low compared with reported values for tropical grasses. 
        During the dry season, the community conserved 71% of the maximum N 
        accumulated in the previous wet season, but 68% of community N content 
        was lost as volatile NH3 during the reproductive phase. N losses were 
        balanced by inputs from precipitation and biological fixation, resulting 
        in a redistribution rather than a loss of nitrogen.</DD></DL>

        Resistance to water vapour transfer from leaves of both species was 
        measured in the field and glasshouse. Bufell grass had the highest 
        maximum above-ground growth rate in summer, but the most striking 
        difference between the two communities was its greater root standing 
        crop and production. Above-ground growth rates were very low in winter, 
        with little difference between the communities. Water use efficiency of 
        the C3 community was about 60% of that of the C4 community. Leaf 
        resistance of the latter was greater under conditions of limiting and

      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Levels of net primary production and efficiencies of energy capture 
        and water use were investigated in six grassland types encompassing ten 
        western North American grasslands. Above-ground net primary productivity 
        (ANPP) ranged from 54 to 523 g/m2/yr; the average for grazed grasslands 
        was 212 g/m2/yr compared with 236 g/m2/yr ungrazed grasslands 
        (P&lt;0.05). There was an apparent linear increase in ANPP with 
        increasing precipitation up to approx. 500 mm/yr. Likewise, ANPP 
        increased linearly with both growing-season and annual actual 
        evapotranspiration (AET). Net root production ranged from 148 to 641 
        g/m2/yr, and was significantly higher on grazed compared with ungrazed 
        grasslands. In general, root production increased with decreasing 
        long-term mean annual temperature. Total net primary productivity (TNPP) 
        ranged from 225 to 1425 g/m2/yr. Approx. 46% and 58% of the variablility 
        in TNPP was explained by annual precipitation in ungrazed and grazed 
        grasslands, respectively. Warmer grasslands had higher rates of crown 
        turnover, corresponding to increased annual usable incident solar 
        radiation and annual AET. Average rates of root turnover were 0.18, 0.30

        respectively, with a positive curvilinear relationship between root 
        turnover and total annual usable incident solar radiation. Efficiency of 
        energy capture in TNPP ranged from 0.12% to more than 1.4% for both 
        ungrazed and grazed grasslands - communities dominated by cool-season 
        species appeared to be comparable to or more efficient than warm-season

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>The relationship between annual forage grass production, and annual 
        and seasonal precipitation and temperature, was evaluated for a 
        shortgrass steppe site in north-central Colorado using a long-term data 
        set (52 years). Forage production is related to above-ground net primary 
        production (ANPP). Precipitation fluctuated randomly, but temperature 
        had clear warming and cooling trends, including a 17-year warming trend 
        from 1974 to 1990. 
        <P></P>
        <DD>Forage production was significantly related to both annual and 
        seasonal precipitation but not to temperature. Precipitation events of 
        15-30 mm accounted for most of the variability in production, because 
        they contributed much of the variability in precipitation, and because 
        they wetted those soil layers which have the largest effect on

        <DD>Production showed time lags of several years in responding to 
        increases in precipitation. Change in vegetation structure has a 
        characteristic response time, which constrains production responses in 
        wet years. Regional ANPP-precipitation models have a steeper slope than 
        long-term models due to this constraint caused by vegetation structure, 
        and this highlights a weakness of exchanging space for time in 
        predicting plant production patterns.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Data are presented from ten central and western North American 
        grasslands, covering six major grasslands types: mountain grassland, 
        northwest bunchgrass, mixed-grass prairie, shortgrass prairie, tallgrass 
        prairie and desert grassland. The experimental design at each location 
        included two replications of ungrazed and grazed treatments. Measured 
        environmental variables included precipitation, temperature and solar 
        radiation, both as annual and growing-season values, along with annual 
        and growing-season actual evapotranspiration. Seasonal above-ground live 
        biomass averaged 94 g/m2 for the ten grasslands (98 g/m2 for ungrazed 
        and 89 g/m2 for grazed treatments). Dead matter averaged about 160 g/m2 
        for ungrazed and 70 g/m2 for grazed treatments. Total above-ground 
        standing crop (total clipped matter) averaged 203 g/m2 (245 g/m2 
        ungrazed; 161 g/m2 grazed). In general, the amount of litter 
        corresponded to the total standing crop. The shortgrass prairie had the 
        greatest amount of crown material, and the tallgrass prairie the least 
        (about 275 g/m2 for short- and mixed-grass prairie, cf. 200 g/m2 for 
        tallgrass prairie). Although grazing did not significantly influence 
        crown material, it tended to increase under grazing in mixed and 
        short-grass prairies. Root biomass ranged from 156 g/m2 in the desert 
        grassland to as much as 2000 g/m2 in the mixed-grass prairie. There was 
        an inverse relationship between root biomass dynamics and mean annual 
        temperature; grazing generally resulted in an increase in root/shoot 
        ratios, particularly for the cooler grassalands.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Intra-seasonal dynamics are presented for the various above-ground 
        and below-ground primary producer compartments for ten central and 
        western North American grassland sites. Above-ground live biomass 
        followed either a unimodal growth pattern (for cool-season or 
        warm-season communities, in general), or a bimodal pattern (for mixed 
        cool- and warm-season communities). There were no significant 
        differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in seasonal live 
        biomass, although there was a significant site x treatment interaction. 
        Peak live biomass ranged from 84 to 336 g/m2, and showed a linear 
        increase with growing-season precipitation up to 450 mm, leveling out 
        beyond that. Maximum accumulation rates of live biomass were 0.4-6.5 
        g/m2/day. The recently-dead compartment showed maximum values soon after 
        attainment of peak live biomass; old-dead, however, was maximal early in 
        the growing season, declining thereafter as material was transferred to 
        the litter compartment. Litter dynamics responded closely to 
        precipitation events, and showed a rather erratic pattern. Root biomass 
        was maximal about midway through the growing season. Grazed treatments 
        typically had a higher peak root biomass in cooler grasslands, whereas 
        no such response was seen in warmer grasslands.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Levels of net primary production and efficiencies of energy capture 
        and water use were investigated in six grassland types encompassing ten 
        western North American grasslands. Above-ground net primary productivity 
        (ANPP) ranged from 54 to 523 g/m2/yr; the average for grazed grasslands 
        was 212 g/m2/yr compared with 236 g/m2/yr ungrazed grasslands 
        (P&lt;0.05). There was an apparent linear increase in ANPP with 
        increasing precipitation up to approx. 500 mm/yr. Likewise, ANPP 
        increased linearly with both growing-season and annual actual 
        evapotranspiration (AET). Net root production ranged from 148 to 641 
        g/m2/yr, and was significantly higher on grazed compared with ungrazed 
        grasslands. In general, root production increased with decreasing 
        long-term mean annual temperature. Total net primary productivity (TNPP) 
        ranged from 225 to 1425 g/m2/yr. Approx. 46% and 58% of the variablility 
        in TNPP was explained by annual precipitation in ungrazed and grazed 
        grasslands, respectively. Warmer grasslands had higher rates of crown 
        turnover, corresponding to increased annual usable incident solar 
        radiation and annual AET. Average rates of root turnover were 0.18, 0.30 
        and 0.49 for mixed-grass, tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, 
        respectively, with a positive curvilinear relationship between root 
        turnover and total annual usable incident solar radiation. Efficiency of 
        energy capture in TNPP ranged from 0.12% to more than 1.4% for both 
        ungrazed and grazed grasslands - communities dominated by cool-season 
        species appeared to be comparable to or more efficient than warm-season 
        species in terms of energy capture. Grasslands with higher water use 
        efficiencies also had higher efficiency of energy capture - these two 
        functional properties appeared to be positively related.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Mid-season above-ground live biomass and dead matter were measured 
        over a 10-year period (1975-84) in a northeast Kansas tallgrass prairie. 
        Study sites included shallow, rocky upland and deep, non-rocky lowland 
        soils for both unburned and burned watersheds, with burning annually in 
        April. Over the 10-year period, lowland sites had significantly greater 
        live biomass than upland sites for both burned and unburned prairie. 
        Live biomass was greater on burned than unburned lowland sites, but was 
        not significantly increased by fire on the upland sites. Averaged across 
        upland and lowland sites, mid-season live biomass was 422 g/m2 on 
        annually burned and 364 g/m2 on unburned sites for the 10-year period. 
        During the severe drought year of 1980, all sites recorded their lowest 
        live biomass for the study period (ranging from 185 to 299 g/m2). Live 
        biomass was most strongly correlated with seasonal pan evaporation (r = 
        -0.45 to -0.82), whereas dead biomass was correlated with the previous 
        year's precipitation (r = 0.61 and 0.90 for upland and lowland sites, 
        respectively). When above-ground biomass was sampled throughout the 1984 
        season and separated into several components, biomass of the graminoids 
        was 40% lower. However, that of forbs and woody plants was 200-300% 
        greater in the unburned than in the annually burned sites.</DD></DL>

        <DD>Patterns of production in American tallgrass prairie and the

        period. Each ecosystem responded differentially to annual or growing 
        season rainfall and solar energy (measured by pan water evaporation). 
        Overall, forest productivity was negatively correlated with annual 
        precipitation, whereas the prairie exhibited no relationship with 
        precipitation. These differences probably reflect the lack of water 
        limitation of the forest and the "downstream" position of the 
        forest.....</DD></DL>

        <DD>Variation in composition, plant biomass and net primary production 
        (NPP) was analyzed for a tropical grassland within the campus of 
        Kurukshetra University. At monthly intervals from May 1970 to May 1971, 
        tillers were analyzed and harvests made for above-ground biomass, 
        standing dead matter, litter and total below-ground biomass. Maximum 
        above-ground biomass occurred in September (1974 g/m2) and maximum 
        below-ground biomass in November (1167 g/m2 to 30 cm). 
        <P></P>
        <DD>Examination of vertical distribution of above-ground biomass showed 
        that different layers of vegetation are dominated by different species 
        in different months. Above-ground NPP was maximum during the rainy 
        season (1706 g/m2) and below-ground NPP was maximal during the dry 
        winter season (785 g/m2). Total NPP was estimated at 3538 g/m2/yr. 
        System transfer functions revealed that production was more directed 
        above ground during the rainy season and below-ground during the dry 
        season. Apparent efficiency of energy conversion was calculated at 1.66%

        productivity are largely dependent upon soil type and climate. The

        <DD>Above-ground biomass and litter dynamics of a grassland steppe in

        two years. <I>Festuca pallescens</I> (St. Yves) Parodi produced about 
        95% of the total annual biomass. Peaks of live biomass were recorded in 
        spring-summer of the first growing season (33.6 g/m2) and in early 
        spring (35 g/m2) and fall (32.7 g/m2) of the second growing season. Less 
        abundant forage grasses included <I>Poa ligularis, Bromus setifolius, 
        Hordeum comosum</I> and <I>Rytidosperma virescens</I>. Shrubs and forbs 
        represented less than 2% of the total annual biomass. The relationships 
        between biomass production of the main species and some environmental 
        variables are discussed. These results will contribute to the knowledge 
        of biomass dynamics and forage availability, and permit the designing of 
        appropriate grazing schedules and range management planning.</DD></DL><!--<H3><A NAME="menaka">MENAKA, MALI</A></H3>

      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>We studied net primary productivity of four contrasting tropical 
        grasslands, and show that these ecosystems are far more productive than 
        earlier suggested, when full account is taken of losses of plant organs 
        above and below-ground. Earlier estimates were provided mainly by the 
        International Biological Programme (IBP), where production was 
        determined on the basis of changes in vegetation mass alone, and would 
        not necessarily have taken full account of organ losses and turnover. 
        Calculations at three of our sites based on established methodology 
        using changes in plant mass alone (i.e. that used by the IBP) proved to 
        be serious underestimates when account was taken of losses 
        simultaneously with measurements of change in plant mass. Accounting for 
        turnover of material at these three sites resulted in productivities up 
        to five times higher than were obtained using the standard IBP 
        procedure. An emergent C4 grass stand at a fourth site in the Amazon 
        attained a productivity which approaches the maximum recorded for 
        agricultural crops. However, estimated productivity at this site, taking 
        into account organ losses, only slightly exceeded that obtained with IBP 
        methods. These conclusions have wider implications in prediction of 
        global carbon cycling by grassland ecosystems, remote sensing of plant 
        productivity and impact assessment of conversion to arable 
crops.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>The annual dynamics of various components and species of the herb 
        layer in broad-leaved deciduous savanna were determined by harvest 
        techniques. Difference methods were used to determine the mean flow rate 
        between components such as above-ground grazeable live biomass, standing 
        dead biomass and litter. Above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) 
        was calculated by integration of a "growth rate" curve, derived from a 
        curve of live biomass during the year which was fitted to field harvest 
        results using two opposing Gompertz functions representing "growth" and 
        "death". "Growth rate" and "death rate" were derived from these, and 
        their difference gave the "rate of change of biomass". These curves also 
        give functions for instantaneous rates, and are useful for computer 
        simulations. 
        <P></P>
        <DD>In the open ground between trees, ANPP of the herb layer was 76 
        g/m2/year (60 g/m2/year for grasses alone; both figures including 10 
        g/m2/year eaten by insects). Averaged over 3 years, the peak rate of 
        biomass accumulation for the grass layer in the open was 5.2 g/m2/week 
        in early December (in the austral summer); however, in one year this was 
        as high as 9.3 g/m2/week. These figures correspond to 0.1 and 0.14 g/g 
        live biomass per day on a dry matter basis. 
        <P></P>
        <DD>Peak grazeable above-ground live biomass was attained between 
        December and mid-February; for the grass layer, this amounted to 88 g/m2 
        in the open, 54 g/m2 beneath the trees, and 78 g/m2 overall. Peak 
        current-year live biomass of the tree and shrub layer was 134 g/m2. 
        Excluding twigs, 188 g/m2 was potentially edible by large herbivores, 
        but species selectivity and restricted browsing height result in 
        incomplete use of this potential. Mean total live plus dead root matter 
        for the grass and tree layers was 3700 g/m2 beneath the trees and 864 
        g/m2 between them. Mean live plus dead matter of the herb layer was 301 
        g/m2.</DD></DL>

      <DL>
        <DD>Tree cover was not significantly related to dry weight of the herb 
        layer before or after burning. The proportion of the herb layer burned 
        was 25% early in the dry season, but averaged 84% from January onwards. 
        Fire temperatures were measured with heat-sensitve paints, and were 
        generally over 540 C at ground level, decreasing with height. 
        Three-quarters of annual above-ground production of herbs is lost when 
        the savanna is burned in December. Late burning for five consecutive 
        years reduced the tree population by 32%.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Data are presented from ten central and western North American 
        grasslands, covering six major grasslands types: mountain grassland, 
        northwest bunchgrass, mixed-grass prairie, shortgrass prairie, tallgrass 
        prairie and desert grassland. The experimental design at each location 
        included two replications of ungrazed and grazed treatments. Measured 
        environmental variables included precipitation, temperature and solar 
        radiation, both as annual and growing-season values, along with annual 
        and growing-season actual evapotranspiration. Seasonal above-ground live 
        biomass averaged 94 g/m2 for the ten grasslands (98 g/m2 for ungrazed 
        and 89 g/m2 for grazed treatments). Dead matter averaged about 160 g/m2 
        for ungrazed and 70 g/m2 for grazed treatments. Total above-ground 
        standing crop (total clipped matter) averaged 203 g/m2 (245 g/m2 
        ungrazed; 161 g/m2 grazed). In general, the amount of litter 
        corresponded to the total standing crop. The shortgrass prairie had the 
        greatest amount of crown material, and the tallgrass prairie the least 
        (about 275 g/m2 for short- and mixed-grass prairie, cf. 200 g/m2 for 
        tallgrass prairie). Although grazing did not significantly influence 
        crown material, it tended to increase under grazing in mixed and 
        short-grass prairies. Root biomass ranged from 156 g/m2 in the desert 
        grassland to as much as 2000 g/m2 in the mixed-grass prairie. There was 
        an inverse relationship between root biomass dynamics and mean annual 
        temperature; grazing generally resulted in an increase in root/shoot 
        ratios, particularly for the cooler grassalands.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Intra-seasonal dynamics are presented for the various above-ground 
        and below-ground primary producer compartments for ten central and 
        western North American grassland sites. Above-ground live biomass 
        followed either a unimodal growth pattern (for cool-season or 
        warm-season communities, in general), or a bimodal pattern (for mixed 
        cool- and warm-season communities). There were no significant 
        differences between grazed and ungrazed treatments in seasonal live 
        biomass, although there was a significant site x treatment interaction. 
        Peak live biomass ranged from 84 to 336 g/m2, and showed a linear 
        increase with growing-season precipitation up to 450 mm, leveling out 
        beyond that. Maximum accumulation rates of live biomass were 0.4-6.5 
        g/m2/day. The recently-dead compartment showed maximum values soon after 
        attainment of peak live biomass; old-dead, however, was maximal early in 
        the growing season, declining thereafter as material was transferred to 
        the litter compartment. Litter dynamics responded closely to 
        precipitation events, and showed a rather erratic pattern. Root biomass 
        was maximal about midway through the growing season. Grazed treatments 
        typically had a higher peak root biomass in cooler grasslands, whereas 
        no such response was seen in warmer grasslands.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Levels of net primary production and efficiencies of energy capture 
        and water use were investigated in six grassland types encompassing ten 
        western North American grasslands. Above-ground net primary productivity 
        (ANPP) ranged from 54 to 523 g/m2/yr; the average for grazed grasslands 
        was 212 g/m2/yr compared with 236 g/m2/yr ungrazed grasslands 
        (P&lt;0.05). There was an apparent linear increase in ANPP with 
        increasing precipitation up to approx. 500 mm/yr. Likewise, ANPP 
        increased linearly with both growing-season and annual actual 
        evapotranspiration (AET). Net root production ranged from 148 to 641 
        g/m2/yr, and was significantly higher on grazed compared with ungrazed 
        grasslands. In general, root production increased with decreasing 
        long-term mean annual temperature. Total net primary productivity (TNPP) 
        ranged from 225 to 1425 g/m2/yr. Approx. 46% and 58% of the variablility 
        in TNPP was explained by annual precipitation in ungrazed and grazed 
        grasslands, respectively. Warmer grasslands had higher rates of crown 
        turnover, corresponding to increased annual usable incident solar 
        radiation and annual AET. Average rates of root turnover were 0.18, 0.30 
        and 0.49 for mixed-grass, tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, 
        respectively, with a positive curvilinear relationship between root 
        turnover and total annual usable incident solar radiation. Efficiency of 
        energy capture in TNPP ranged from 0.12% to more than 1.4% for both 
        ungrazed and grazed grasslands - communities dominated by cool-season 
        species appeared to be comparable to or more efficient than warm-season 
        species in terms of energy capture. Grasslands with higher water use 
        efficiencies also had higher efficiency of energy capture - these two 
        functional properties appeared to be positively related.</DD></DL>

      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Above-ground net primary production (ANPP) of the Patagonian steppe 
        in south-western Chubut (Argentina) was estimated using a harvest 
        technique to assess the herbaceous (mainly grass) component and a double 
        sampling technique to evaluate shrub production. The latter technique 
        involves the measurement of plant dimensions and the harvest of shrub 
        biomass in small plots. By virtue of having an explicit biological model 
        which considers both shrub size and production per unit surface of 
        plant, this technique allows comparisons between years, sites and 
        treatments. Detailed estimates of ANPP gave a value of 79 g dry matter 
        (DM)/m2/year (S.E. = 19 g DM/m2/year) for an annual rainfall of 191 mm. 
        This estimate of ANPP fits (±17%) the predictions of four models 
        relating primary production to annual precipitation. Two thirds of 
        production was accounted for by perennial grasses and one third by 
        shrubs. A less detailed method, which uses only peak biomass, gave ANPP 
        estimates for four additional years ranging from 21 to 75 g DM/m2/year, 
        whilst annual precipitation over this period amounted to 55-167 mm. 
        During a year of extreme drought, there was a large reduction in ANPP; 
        however, there were no increases in ANPP during years with above-average 
        precipitation. This suggests that the relationship between carrying 
        capacity and precipitation for the Patagonian steppe may be 
        non-linear.</DD></DL><!--<H3><A NAME="salado">SALADO</A></H3>

        application trial on the hay yields, botanical composition and soil 
        properties of veld (savanna grassland). Significant increases in hay 
        yields were recorded during most years, with a strong correlation

        levels. The basal cover of the <I>Paniceae</I> generally increased with 
        N and P fertiliser application, but the <I>Eragrosteae</I> showed little

        However, higher levels of N x P resulted in greater rates of water 
        infiltration than in the control plots, although initial infiltration 
        rates were greatest in the control plots. Despite some undesirable

        simulation was used to determine the linkage between environmental and

        Mongolian Steppe. Early growing seasonal precipitation is one of the 
        major driving factors for plant productivity in this ecosystem. The 
        sandy soils of the Mongolian Steppe contribute to plant productivity, 
        and are more susceptible to soil carbon losses under increased grazing 
        intensity. Over most of their area, Mongolian grasslands are in good 
        condition in terms of soil organic matter content. However, these 
        grassland ecosystems are susceptible to changes in grazing management.

        interannual variation of precipitation and temperature during 1981-1990 
        in the Tumugi, Xingan League, eastern Inner Mongolia, China. Average 
        annual precipitation was 411 mm. Peak live aboveground biomass (PLAB) 
        was 152 g/m2 for <I>F. sibiricum</I> and <I>S. baicalensis</I> steppe 
        and 162 g/m2 for <I>L. chinense</I> steppe. Peak live belowground 
        biomass (PLBB) varied between 968 g/m2 for <I>F. sibiricum</I> steppe 
        and 1022 g m/2 for <I>L. chinense</I> steppe. The coefficient of 
        variation (CV) in annual precipitation (25%) was lower than the CV in 
        PLAB (35% to 37%) but larger than the CV in PLBB (10%) of the three

        observed soil organic matter, seasonal dynamics and interannual 
        variation of plant biomass of these three steppe sites during 1981-1990. 
        The CENTURY model is slightly more successful than the empirical 
        regression models that use annual precipitation to estimate PLAB of

      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>We examined the effects of rainfall amount, rainfall distribution 
        and grazing intensity on net primary production (NPP) and herbivory for 
        a dry tropical savanna. In a permanently protected savanna, above-ground 
        and below-ground NPP ranged from 329 to 741 g/m2/yr, and from 404 to 838 
        g/m2/yr, respectively. Both were positively correlated to annual 
        rainfall, and were more sensitive to late rainy season rainfall than 
        early rains. Total herbaceous NPP ranged from 836 to 1579 g/m2/yr, and 
        total herbaceous + woody NPP ranged from 1190 to 1910 g/m2/yr. This is 
        similar to the NPP of native tropical dry deciduous forest, except that 
        the production of herbaceous species is 61% lower in the forest. 
        Including below-ground NPP in the 0-50 cm soil layer, total NPP was 
        higher than that of native forest. 
        <P></P>
        <DD>Grazing stimulated 4-45% increase in above-ground NPP, with greater 
        effect in light or moderately grazed sites; however, it reduced 
        below-ground NPP by 25-65%, with the greatest effect in heavily grazed 
        sites. Below-ground NPP in grazed sites was inversely related to 
        rainfall. By comparing NPP within and without temporarily fenced plots, 
        herbivore consumption was estimated at 476-734 g/m2/yr; this was

        soil moisture, was highest in a high rainfall year.</DD></DL>

      <H3>Summary</H3>
      <DD>
      <DL>
        <DD>Long-term dynamics of above-ground biomass, net primary production 
        and efficiencies of water use are reported for 1980-1989 in the 
        <I>Leymus chinense</I> (syn. <I>Aneurolepidium chinense</I>) steppe of 
        the Xilin river basin, within the Unesco/MAB Xilingol Steppe Biosphere 
        Reserve, Inner Mongolia. The response of above-ground biomass to 
        interannual fluctuations in precipitation and temperature was examined 
        at the levels of community, growth form and species. Annual above-ground 
        net primary production (ANPP) varied from 154 g/m2/year in 1980 to 319 
        g/m2/year in 1988, with a mean of 249 g/m2/year and a coefficient of 
        variation of 25%. ANPP was not significantly correlated to annual 
        precipitation and total precipitation during April-September (p&lt;0.05 
        level), but precipitation in May and August accounted for 69% of 
        interannual variation of ANPP. Mean values for rain use efficiency and 
        water use efficiency were 8.1 kg (DM) ha/mm/year and 0.89 g/mm, 
        respectively.

        <DD>The above-ground biomass of various growth forms and species showed 
        different response patterns to interannual variation of precipitation 
        and temperature. Monthly and seasonal distributions of precipitation and 
        temperature were the key controls for above-ground biomass of individual 
        species.</DD></DL>
